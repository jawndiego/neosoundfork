# Create Net Label

## Out of the box:
- [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) configured for your ethers jazz.
- [RainbowKit]() for Wallet Connect

## Styling:
- Base styling is achieved with [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/). Make sure to check the docs if you are not familiar. Also try out [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) if you are using VSCode.

### TODO
- Generate component specific class selectors for additional styling.
- Merge className prop on outermost container. [Gh issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7214)
